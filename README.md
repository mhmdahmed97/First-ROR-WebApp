# README

This is a very basic app built on ROR. I will write down as many details as possible for beginners.
 ---- FOR BEGINNERS ----
 1. clone the repo
 2. cd into the directory
 3. use command "rails server"
 4. this will run the webapp on your localhost:3000
 
 Once its up and running I have a few pages (Home(index), contact, About)
---> This will be updated accordingly as I learn and update the app
